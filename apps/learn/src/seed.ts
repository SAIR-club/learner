/**
 * A starting topic, so a learner is not staring at an empty graph.
 *
 * A cognition system that begins empty cannot demonstrate its own point: retrieval has nothing to retrieve,
 * and the learner's first question produces the same blank answer a stateless chatbot would give. Seeding
 * gives the first question something to find.
 *
 * ## What is seeded, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Every node here is **reference material about the transformer architecture** — public, sourced, and
 * carrying no cognitive state. The learner's own claims and their understanding of anything are *not*
 * seeded, because those are the things this system exists to record rather than to assume. A seeded
 * `StateEvent` would be the system telling someone what they understand.
 *
 * The set is small on purpose. It is enough to make retrieval meaningful — a paraphrase, a hard negative,
 * and a graph worth walking — without pretending to be a curriculum.
