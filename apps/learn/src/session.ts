/**
 * The Learn interaction session.
 *
 * This is the smallest surface on which the project's claim can actually be used rather than asserted:
 * a learner asks, sees which of their own prior understanding was retrieved **and why**, records what
 * they now understand, and the next answer is built on it.
 *
 * Three deliberate properties:
 *
 * 1. **Every answer is produced by the same retrieval that is displayed.** The reasons shown are the
 *    contributions that produced the ranking shown, from one call. A view that showed reasons fetched
 *    separately could disagree with the order next to them.
 * 2. **The agent cannot write.** Recording understanding goes through `record()`, which commits a
 *    `StateEvent` authored by the *human*; the agent only ever supplies answer text. The
 *    `core/ai-cannot-author-state` guard enforces this, and nothing here bypasses it.
 * 3. **Nothing is held only in memory.** Every recorded understanding is persisted, so the session can be
 *    closed and reopened, which is the whole point of the earlier phases.
