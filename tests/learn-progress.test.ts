 * The retrieval panel answers "what is relevant to this question" and the graph listing answers "what
 * exists". Neither answers *"what did I get out of this"*, which is the question a learner has after using
 * the loop a while. This is the only thing on the surface that says whether a session changed anything.
 *
 * It deliberately reuses the same reading of state that ranking uses, so it cannot tell a learner their
 * understanding is settled while the cognitive signal is treating it as shaky.
