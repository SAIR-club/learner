/**
 * The Learn interaction surface.
 *
 * Phases 0–2 proved the *machinery*: history is append-only, state survives a restart, a paraphrase reaches
 * stored cognition. None of that tested whether a person can actually use it. This file tests the surface
 * itself, and it asserts the three things that make it a surface rather than a wrapper:
 *
 * 1. a learner can ask in their own words and get the retrieval *reasons*, not just an answer;
 * 2. recording understanding changes the next answer, and the change is caused by the record;
 * 3. the whole loop survives closing and reopening the process.
